BETA VERSION


Photo is an image viewer with a simple and fast interface, being good looking and highly configureable.


DEPENDENCIES
------------
Qt >= 4.7
exiv2
cmake (needed for building Photo)

Note: On some systems you also need the *-dev for compiling (e.g. exiv2-dev - names can vary slightly depending
on your distribution). These files usually can be removed again after compilation is done.


INSTALL
-------

1) cd build/

2) cmake .. # Note: This installs Photo by default into /usr/local/{bin,share}

   # To install Photo into e.g. /usr/{bin,share}, run:
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
   
   # CMake expects the phonon libs to be in /usr/include/phonon.
   # If you're storing them in a different place, you need to tell cmake:
   cmake -DQT_PHONON_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/phonon/include/dir ..

3) make  # This creates an executeable photo binary located in the source folder

4) (as root) make install  # This (i) installs the desktop file to /usr/share/applications/
				(ii) moves some icons to /usr/share/icons/hicolor/
				(iii) moves the binary to /usr/bin


ALTERNATIVE INSTALL
-------------------

The above way using cmake is the recommended way of installing Photo.
Of course, it is also possible to compile photo the old way with "qmake" and "make". However, after compiling
Photo this way you need to move all the files to their right location manually.



UNINSTALL
---------
If you want to uninstall Photo, simply run "make uninstall" as root. This removes the desktop file (via
"xdg-desktop-menu uninstall"), the icons and the binary file. Alternatively you can simply remove all the files
manually, that should yield the same result.
