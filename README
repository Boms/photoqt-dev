-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:
THIS IS A BETA RELEASE INTENDED FOR TESTING AND TRANSLATION!


Photo is an image viewer with a simple and fast interface, being good looking and highly configureable.


DEPENDENCIES
------------
Qt >= 4.7
exiv2
cmake (needed for building Photo)

Note: On some systems *-dev files are also needed for compiling (e.g. exiv2-dev). they usually can be removed again after compilation is done.


INSTALL
-------

1) cd build/

2) cmake .. # Note: This installs Photo by cmake default into /usr/local/{bin,share}

   # To install Photo into e.g. /usr/{bin,share}, run:
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

3) make  # This creates an executeable photo binary located in the source folder

4) (as root) make install  # This (i) installs the desktop file to ${XDG_APPS_INSTALL_DIR} (on many systems /usr/share/applications)
				(ii) Installs some icons into the ${ICON_INSTALL_DIR}/hicolor/ folders
				(iii) moves the binary to global binary directory ${BIN_INSTALL_DIR}


ALTERNATIVE INSTALL
-------------------

The above way usign cmake is the recommended way of installing Photo.
Of course, it is also possible to compile photo the old way with "qmake" and "make". However, after compiling photo this way you need to move all the files to their right location manually.



UNINSTALL
---------
If you want to uninstall Photo, simply run "make uninstall" as root. This removes the desktop file (via "xdg-desktop-menu uninstall"), the icons and the binary file. Alternatively you can simply remove all the files manually, that should yield the same result.
