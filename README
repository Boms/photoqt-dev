DEVELOPMENT VERSION

POSSIBLY UNSTABLE
*********************

PhotoQt is a fast and highly configurable image viewer with a simple and nice interface.


DEPENDENCIES
------------
Qt >= 4.7
cmake (needed for building PhotoQt)

>> Dependencies, that can be disabled via cmake (see INSTALL section):
exiv2
Phonon
GraphicsMagick


Note: On some systems you also need the *-dev package for compiling (e.g. exiv2-dev - names can vary slightly depending
on your distribution). These files usually can be removed again after compilation is done.


INSTALL
-------

1) cd build/

2) cmake .. 	# Note: This installs PhotoQt by default into /usr/local/{bin,share}

   # To install PhotoQt into e.g. /usr/{bin,share}, run:
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
   
   # CMake expects the phonon libs to be in /usr/include/phonon.
   # If you're storing them in a different place, you need to tell cmake:
   cmake -DQT_PHONON_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/phonon/include/dir ..
   
   # PhotoQt makes use of different libraries: exiv2, phonon, graphicsmagick.
   # You can en-/disable them with the following options:
   -DWITH_EXIV2=OFF		# default: ON
   -DWITH_PHONON=OFF		# default: ON
   -DWITH_GRAPHICSMAGICK=OFF	# default: ON
   # You can combine them in any way you want.
   # The following option equates to setting the three above options to OFF
   -DWITH_QTONLY=ON		# default: OFF
   # Note: -DWITH_QTONLY overwrites the other three options above!
   

3) make  # This creates an executeable photoqt binary located in the source folder

4) (as root) make install  # This (i) installs the desktop file to /usr/share/applications/
				(ii) moves some icons to /usr/share/icons/hicolor/
				(iii) moves the binary to /usr/bin



UNINSTALL
---------
If you want to uninstall PhotoQt, simply run "make uninstall" as root. This removes the desktop file (via
"xdg-desktop-menu uninstall"), the icons and the binary file. Alternatively you can simply remove all the files
manually, that should yield the same result.
