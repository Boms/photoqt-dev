"Photo is a simple image viewer, designed to be good looking, highly "
"configurable, yet easy to use and fast."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"Photo\" is not a very creative name for an image viewer. There are so many "
"better names possible. So why is Photo called \"Photo\"? Well, as I started "
"out programming what should become version 0.1, I never really thought of "
"actually developing it as far as it is now. I actually wasn't sure if I "
"should upload it somewhere at all. I eventually decided to give it a go, and "
"I uploaded it at qt-apps.org. And, well, of course, if you want to upload a "
"project there (as probably everywhere else too), you need to give it a "
"name. And the first thing that came to my mind was \"photo\", just to satisfy "
"the upload form of qt-apps.org..."

"I'm not a trained programmer. I'm a simple Maths student that loves doing "
"stuff like this. All I know about programming I taught myself over the "
"years. So Photo is certainly not done in the best of ways. Many things could "
"probably be improved (from a programming point of view). But it's as good "
"as I can do it. And I'm constantly learning and improving things. So you "
"sometimes have to be a little patient with me :)"

"I heard a number of times people saying, that Photo is a \"copy\" of Picasa's "
"image viewer. Well, it's not. In fact, I myself have never used Picasa. I "
"have seen it in use though by others, and I can't deny that it influenced "
"the basic design idea a little. But I'm not trying to do something \"like "
"Picasa\". I try to do my own thing, and to do it as good as I can. If some "
"consider it to be a replacement for Picasa, well, I feel a little honoured "
"(since Picasa is created by \"proper\" programmers)."
